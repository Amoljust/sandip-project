 \end{itemize}
 The main objectives of “Online Movie Ticket Booking System” project are as follows. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ability to store the information of new customer and different types of movie show timing and ticket rates of different types on show class etc
    \item Interest to develop a good user friendly website with many online transactions using a database.
    \item Ability to generate different reports and which are helpful for the management in decision making.
    \item Ability to change users password account.

\end{itemize}
\section{Challenges}
Developing and implementing voice recognize technology can be costly. Balancing the desired features with budget con-strains is a challenge. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single Platform Multiple Booking Types: }
If you are willing to sell multiple types of products or services on your store then, you definitely require an option to select the booking type as per your business requirement. Let’s understand it with an instance. 
    \item \textbf{Slot Management:} Close Bookings 
What if you are planning a vacation and want to prevent bookings on specific days? If this is the case, you definitely require a system that lets you close certain dates to avoid bookings on those dates.
    \item \textbf{Booking Cancellation Option for Customers }
It’s always been challenging to manage online booking cancellations. 
If you provide the booking cancellation option to customers, you will frequently receive tons of booking cancellation requests from the customers that are too complex to manage. On the other hand, if you will not provide the cancel booking option to your customers, you will be flooded with bookings or probably start receiving spams. 

    \item \textbf{Price Per Booking:} Time Slot Management 
It’s quite complex to manually set up a different price for each booking slot. In order to have a flexible price for each booking, your online booking system should be capable enough to show a different slot price of the same booking product on different dates. 

    \item \textbf{ Manage Bookings via Calendar:}
Once your online booking business glows at a higher pace, it’s become quite complex to manage tons of bookings. There, you need a booking calendar using which you can keep track of each booking in one place. 
If your system is integrated with Google calendar, the customer will receive the Google calendar link on the confirmation of each booking. Thus, both you and your customers can manage bookings accordingly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
It may help collecting perfect management in details. In a very short time, the collection will be obvious, simple and sensible. It will help a person to know the management of passed year perfectly and vividly. It also helps in current all works relative to Online Movie Ticket Booking System. It will be also reduced the cost of collecting the management and collection procedure will go on smoothly.

\chapter{Existing system and Dis-advantages}
\hspace*{0.3 in}	Lane Line detection is a critical component for self-driving cars and also for computer vision in general. This concept is used to describe the path for self- driving cars and to avoid the risk of getting in another lane.
	

\\
\hspace*{0.3 in}Using computer vision and machine learning techniques in Python, we will identify road lane lines in which autonomous cars must run. This will be a critical part of autonomous cars, as the self-driving cars should not cross its lane and should not go in opposite lane to avoid accidents.
To detect white markings in the lane, first, we need to mask the rest part of the frame. We do this using frame masking. The frame is nothing but a NumPy array of image pixel values. To mask the unnecessary pixel of the frame, we simply update those pixel values to 0 in the NumPy array.
	After making it we need to detect lane lines. The technique used to detect mathematical shapes like this is called Hough Transform. Hough transformation can detect shapes like rectangles, circles, triangles, and lines.

Machine Learning as a part. Data sets of predefined sign language are used as the input so that the software can use artificial Intelligence to display the converted audio into the sign language.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\chapter{PROBLEM DEFINITION}
\hspace*{0.3 in}	Saha et al. [2012] [1] discussed an algorithm for detection of marks of road lanes and road boundary by using intelligent vehicles. It converted the RGB road scene image into gray image and employed the flood-fill algorithm to label the connected components of that gray image. After that the largest connected component obtained by the algorithm and which was the road region was extracted. The unwanted region was detected and subtracted like outer-side of the road. The extracted connected component was filtered to detect white marks of road lane and road boundary. The road lane detection algorithm still had some problems such as critical shadow condition of the image and color of road lanes other than white.\\
Tseng et al. [2005] [2] gave a lane marking detection algorithm by using geometry information and modified Hough transform. In that algorithm the captured image was divided into road part and non-road part by using camera geometry information. The color road image was quantized into a binary image. The modified Hough transform with road geometry consideration was used to detect the lane markings. The histogram of intensities was applied to quantize the road image into a binary image. A modified Hough transform method has been developed to detect the lane markings in road image by using the road geometry information. It was time consuming because Hough transform was a full search algorithm in parameter space. It also failed when the lane boundaries intersected in a region which was a non-road part.\\
 Shen et al. [2012] [3] discussed a monocular vision system that could locate the positions of the road lane in real time. An algorithm proposed for lane detection using single camera.

\chapter{PROPOSED SYSTEM}
With the rapid development of science and technology, intelligent cars, as representatives of intelligent products, have become a hot research topic today. The gradual growth of the automobile industry has led to a rapid increase in the number of automobiles in India, but the traffic problem has become increasingly prominent, which seriously threatens people's travel safety. Autopilot technology is particularly important, and a lot of research and development have been made at home and abroad. In the Spring Festival of 2018, Baidu Apollo platform staged the driving charm of unmanned vehicles on the Mubai Bandra-Worli Sea Link, reflecting the maturity of India’s autonomous driving technology.  \\ 
\section{overview}
\hspace*{0.3 in}Lane line detection technology is the important technology of unmanned driving. The correctness of the detection directly determines whether the driving is safe. The basic idea is to obtain the current road information through the on-board camera, and use the relevant algorithm to detect the left and right lane lines of the lane (if there is no lane line on the right, the road edge is detected), finally, the vehicle travel decision is made. Since unmanned driving is online in real time, the environment in each time slot is different, so real-time is also important while ensuring the correct rate. At present, based on the development status at home and abroad, the algorithm of lane line detection can be roughly divided into two types, which are based on feature and segmentation based on model. In 2018, Y. Su proposed a robust vanishing point constraint lane detection method based on stereo platform. This method can detect both straight lane and curve lane without considering any parameter lane model. \\
\section{block Diagram}
\hspace*{0.3 in}C Lee proposed a robust and real-time lane detection algorithm based on vision. The algorithm has an effective region of interest and can effectively reduce the high noise level and computation time. The algorithm can process a gradient cue and a color cue together and a line clustering with scan-line tests to verify the characteristics of the lane markings. X. W. Wei used improved Hough transform to realize Lane detection. By controlling the slope of two lanes before and after comparison, a limitation is made near the previously detected lane line area, set ROI and perform the search of diagonal pixels to reconstruct the corner part. In this paper, a lane line detection algorithm based on improved Hough transform is proposed in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. \\
\section{system architecture}
\hspace*{0.3 in} In order to improve the real time of image processing and reduce the interference of useless factors in the image, wavelet lifting is used to process the image to extract low-frequency wavelet coefficients sub-images; Compared with the traditional gray average binarization algorithm and maximum entropy binarization algorithm, the binarization image processing based on edge features can retain more original details of the image, which is conducive to processing the image obtained under weak illumination intensity; Then the conditional constraints are added to Hough transform to improve the accuracy and real-time performance of detection; Finally, the improved Hough transform method is used to detect the lane line to eliminate the interference line and pseudo-lane line, and the correct lane line is extracted by fitting the straight line with regression analysis method. \\
\hspace*{0.3 in} Traffic accidents have become one of the most serious problems in today’s world. Roads are the mostly chosen modes of transportation and provide the finest connections among all modes. Most frequently occurring traffic problem is the negligence of the drivers and it has become more and more serious with the increase of vehicles. Increasing the safety and saving lives of human beings is one of the basic functions of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Intelligent transportation systems are advanced applications which aim to provide innovative services relating to different modes of transport and traffic management. This system enables various users to be better informed and make safer, more coordinated, and smarter use of transport networks. These road accidents can be reduced with the help of road lanes or white markers that assist the driver to identify the road area and non-road area. A lane is a part of the road marked which can be used by a single line of vehicles as to control and guide drivers so that the traffic conflicts can be reduced.

\end{enumerate}
\hspace*{0.3 in} The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining why the technique works.Canny edge detection is a technique to extract useful structural information from different vision objects and dramatically reduce the amount of data to be processed. It has been widely applied in various computer vision systems. Canny has found that the requirements for the application of edge detection on diverse vision systems are relatively similar. Thus, an edge detection solution to address these requirements can be implemented in a wide range of situations.\\

\chapter{METHODOLOGY}
\section{proposed algorithm}
\hspace*{0.3 in}Visual input on a Doc Camera, and process these images using python modules.
We firstly extract the color features based on the white color and then extract the edge features based on the straight lane. Because the high-speed section is the traffic accident-prone section, the high-speed road section mostly is the straight- line lane. Therefore, in order to obtain a very high recognition rate, we successively carry-on color detection and edge detection to the lane. This paper combines color features extraction and edge features extraction, and the experiment proves that the recognition rate and accuracy of lane detection are greatly improved.\\
\section{technology used}
\hspace*{0.3 in}Our main contribution in this paper is to do a lot of work in the pre-processing stage. We proposed to perform color transform of HSV in the pre-processing stage, then extract white, and then perform conventional pre-processing operations in sequence. Moreover, we selected an improved method proposed in the area of interest (ROI). In this paper, based on the proposed pre-processing method, one-half part of the processed image is selected as the area of interest. In addition, we performed twice edge detection. The first is in the pre-processing stage, and the second is in the lane detection stage after the ROI is selected. The purpose of performing twice edge detection is to enhance the lane recognition rate.\\

\chapter{CONCLUSISON}
A real time vision-based lane detection method was proposed. Image segmentation and removing the shadow of the road were processed. Canny operator was used to detect edges that represent road lanes or road boundaries. A hyperbola-pair road model used to deal with the occlusion and imperfect road condition. A series of experiment showed that the lanes were detected using Hough transformation with restricted search area and the projection of their intersection will form the last scan point called the horizon. Furthermore, in order to search out for the left and right vector points that represent the road lanes, the lane scan boundary phase uses the edge image and the left and right Hough lines and the horizon line as inputs, to effectively allocate the lane points. That was demonstrated by two hyperbola lines. The experimental results showed that the system is able to achieve a standard requirement to provide valuable information to the driver to ensure safety.
